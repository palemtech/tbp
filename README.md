## Tasks

### copy

Copies data from Paratext folder to `plm_texts` where SAB can find it. It also does some processing to bring footnotes inline with what we are doing (creating mini Glossary entries for them) and fixes some problems we had with figures.


```zsh
uv run ~/OneDrive/_Areas/10\ tbp_scripts/copy_tbp_files.py update-files
uv run ~/OneDrive/_Areas/10\ tbp_scripts/process_footnotes_to_glo.py prep "@"
uv run ~/OneDrive/_Areas/10\ tbp_scripts/fix_figures.py
```

### publish

Publish new version of the web app on github pages based on the html output from SAB.

Inputs: MSG

```zsh
if [ -z "$MSG" ]
then
    echo "No commit message given. Exiting"
else
uv run ~/OneDrive/_Areas/10\ tbp_scripts/copy_tbp_files.py update-app
uv run ~/OneDrive/_Areas/10\ tbp_scripts/replace_xrs.py
uv run ~/OneDrive/_Areas/10\ tbp_scripts/process_footnotes_to_glo.py finish 
uv run ./update-index.py
