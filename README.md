## Tasks

### copy

Copies data from Paratext folder to `plm_texts` where SAB can find it. It also does some processing to bring footnotes inline with what we are doing (creating mini Glossary entries for them) and fixes some problems we had with figures.


```zsh
~/OneDrive/_Areas/10\ tbp_scripts/copy_tbp_files.py update-files
~/OneDrive/_Areas/10\ tbp_scripts/process_footnotes_to_glo.py prep "@"
~/OneDrive/_Areas/10\ tbp_scripts/fix_figures.py
```

### publish

Publish new version of the web app on github pages based on the html output from SAB.

Inputs: MSG

if [ -z "$MSG" ]

    echo "No commit message given. Exiting"
